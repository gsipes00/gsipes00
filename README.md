Hello my name is Gene! I am 38 years old at this time of writting in early 2022. By career I work as a GIS Specialist for my local government, and by interest I pursue
passions outside of work to learn to program. I'm still learning exactly what it is I want to do, but currently I am enjoying learning the backend with Node.js and Express. As I progress in my studies I am certainly interested in learning more about the front end with React and AJAX. One day at a time, and one step at I time, I will continue to follow my passions and see where this interest takes me. Ultimately I hope to work in web development one day, and if I keep up the practice it's possible I could reach that goal in 2023. Wish me luck!

As an aside, I am also extrememly passionate about blockchain technology and follow the development of the Cardano ecosystem closely. Cheers!
