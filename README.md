Hello my name is Gene! I am 38 years old at time of writting in early 2022. By career I work as a GIS Specialist for my local government, by passion I am learning web development in my free-time. Specifically I am interested in front and backend web development, and I am currently learning the backend API architecture via Node.js, Express, and MongoDB/Mongoose. Next my plan is to learn frontend development by way of React and AJAX. Besides that I'm a family man with a wife and two young children that I love very much! 
As an aside, I am also extrememly passionate about blockchain technology and follow the development of the Cardano ecosystem closely. Cheers!
